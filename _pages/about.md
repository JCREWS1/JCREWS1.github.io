Hi, I'm John Crews, an ambitious undergraduate at UMBC, where I've taken the initiative to design my own major in Management of Geospatial Data for National Security. My academic journey has revolved around my passions for geography, environmental science, and military science. I'm eagerly anticipating the opportunity to forge a career that merges these interests and allows me to safeguard and improve the lives of those around me.

Throughout my studies, I've cultivated a diverse range of expertise, including spatial analysis, sustainable development, and proficiency in GIS software like ESRI ArcGIS and QGIS. My exploration of mapping and remote sensing techniques has fostered a keen eye for land cover classification. I'm particularly fascinated by the power of geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) in tackling real-world challenges head-on.

One of my notable projects involved delving into the intricate realm of processing and analyzing remote sensing data. This hands-on experience enabled me to extract valuable insights and patterns. Moreover, I've honed my skills in producing captivating maps that seamlessly convey complex geospatial information to diverse audiences.

Beyond academic achievements, my unwavering dedication to national security ignites my drive. I yearn to make a positive impact by applying my talents in mapping and remote sensing to confront pressing challenges in this realm. My ultimate goal is to commission into the Air Force and contribute my expertise to a government agency intently focused on GEOINT. This would afford me the opportunity to serve my country while harnessing my passion for utilizing cutting-edge technologies and geospatial analysis for the greater good.

To stay at the forefront of advancements in mapping and remote sensing technologies, I actively participate in conferences and workshops. Engaging with professionals and researchers not only expands my network but also grants me invaluable insights into emerging trends and innovative applications within the field.

As graduation draws nearer, I'm eagerly seeking opportunities that will enable me to channel my skills in geospatial analysis, national security, and GEOINT. With an unwavering commitment to my country, I'm confident that my expertise in mapping and remote sensing, combined with my relentless dedication, will allow me to make substantial contributions to government agencies focused on safeguarding national security and leveraging geospatial intelligence.
