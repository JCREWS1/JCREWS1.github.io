This study looked at public transportation in Baltimore and how it affects the city's residents. We found that many people in Baltimore don't have cars, especially in lower-income areas. These areas are also far from public transit stops, making it difficult for people to get around. The study shows that we need to improve public transportation in Baltimore to help everyone, especially those who can't afford a car. By considering the needs of different communities, we can create a fair and better transportation system in the city.
